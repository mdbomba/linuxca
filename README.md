There is certificate (Subject) data located in openssl_intermediate.cnf and in set-ca.sh. If you want to change the certificate Subject info, you need to edit both.

These scripts are consolidated primarily from the work represented at the following URLs

https://www.golinuxcloud.com/openssl-create-certificate-chain-linux/

https://www.golinuxcloud.com/openssl-subject-alternative-name/

I recommend you open these links and verify my scripts before using them.
